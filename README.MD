About
This project is from a full stack Node.JS course by Jonas Schmidt.

Description
This project is the main project build in Jonas's Node.JS course. The project itself takes about 40hrs of video, but this took me closer to 150 hours to complete. The project teaches how to build a backend for an online store. Building this I learned the fundamentals of routing, MVC architecture, backend security measures, authentication, database usage, server side rendering, using cookies, and much more.

The project is a mock tour online shop. Visitors are able to visit the store, browse selections, create an account, make updates to user info, login, and make purchases using Stripe.
